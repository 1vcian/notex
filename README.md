# Notex

A minimalist, single-pane Markdown editor that stores its content directly in the URL hash.

## Utility

This tool is designed for instant sharing. Since the entire content of the page is compressed and stored in the URL, you don't need a database or a backend to share notes. Simply type your Markdown, copy the URL, and send it to someone else. They will see exactly what you wrote.

## Features

- Real-time Markdown rendering as you type.
- Single-pane interactive interface.
- Automatic URL updates using LZ-based compression.
- Completely serverless (works on GitHub Pages).


## How to use

1. Start typing your Markdown.
2. The preview renders live behind your text.
3. Copy the browser URL to share your note with others.
